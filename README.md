# foapy

**foapy** is a Python library for Formal Order Analysis (FOA), providing a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and characterizing sequences, orders, and their structural properties. The library is designed for researchers, data scientists, and developers interested in symbolic sequence analysis, combinatorics, information theory, and related fields.

## Features

- **Alphabets and Orders:** Tools to define and manipulate alphabets, generate and analyze orders, and extract structural information from sequences.
- **Intervals and Chains:** Compute intervals, interval chains, and distributions for sequences, supporting both basic and advanced FOA concepts.
- **Congeneric Decomposition:** Decompose sequences into congeneric components, enabling detailed structural and informational analysis.
- **Mathematical Characteristics:** Calculate a wide range of characteristics, including arithmetic mean, geometric mean, volume, average remoteness, depth, descriptive and identifying information, regularity, and uniformity.
- **Extensive Documentation:** In-depth explanations of mathematical foundations, algorithms, and usage examples.
- **Test Suite:** Comprehensive tests to ensure correctness and reliability.
