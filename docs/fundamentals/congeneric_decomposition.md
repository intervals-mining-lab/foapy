# Congeneric Decomposition

Congeneric decomposition is a fundamental concept in sequence analysis that allows us to break down complex sequences into simpler, related components.

## Overview

Congeneric decomposition provides a systematic way to analyze and understand sequences by decomposing them into related (congeneric) parts.

## Key Concepts

- Congeneric sequences
- Congeneric orders
- Congeneric intervals
- Congeneric distributions

## Applications

Congeneric decomposition has wide applications in:
- Text analysis
- Bioinformatics
- Music theory
- Pattern recognition
