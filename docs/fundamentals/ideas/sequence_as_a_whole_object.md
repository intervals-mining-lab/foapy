# Sequence as a whole object

Symbol sequences are a common model in many theoretical and applied science areas.
This prevalence is since almost any object of study can be represented as a sequence of elements or events.

However, if we set aside our knowledge of the essence of the elements in a specific case and
consider the sequence as a separate object of study, then only probabilistic (statistical) methods or
various methods for comparing sequences (for example, the Levenshtein distance) are used.

None of these methods describes the sequence as a holistic object.
The Levenshtein distance requires a different sequence to compare with the original one, which makes
the measures of this approach "relative". The probabilistic approach decomposes the sequence into
elements and calculates their probabilities. Thus, the sequence is replaced, as an object of study,
by a probability distribution. In turn, a specific probability distribution corresponds to an infinite
number of sequences with a ratio of elements "close" to the one in the original sequence.
Moments, conditional probabilities, Shannon entropy, and Markov chains allow us to more accurately
model the object under study, but they still essentially rely on the idea of ​​decomposing a sequence
into independent elements, ignoring the sequence as a holistic object. Practically all existing approaches
to the study and description of symbolic sequences originate from the set-theoretic approach.

Formal order analysis is based on the belief that a symbolic sequence can be considered as a holistic object
with emergent properties, which corresponds to systems thinking. This method studies, in addition to the set
of elements, the internal structure (pattern) of the sequence, which determines its uniqueness
among others, including those consisting of the same set of elements.
