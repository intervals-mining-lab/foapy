def depth(intervals):
    """
    Calculation of the depth of a sequence:
    Depth is calculated as the logarithm base 2 (logâ‚‚) of the volume,
    where the volume is the product of the elements
    of the intervals in the sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: two-dimensional intervals sequence array
        Source array sequence.


    Returns
    -------
    result: array.
